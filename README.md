<h1> Overview </h1>

Project developed from scratch with the purpose of fixating basic
javascript concepts like DOM manipulation, array and string methods, conditional
operators, the local storage API, amongst others.

The app main functionality is a finance tracker, which can receive incomes and expenses, calculates balance and, should there be any, renders
all previous entries.
